Brume
=====

Brume is a lightweight static website manager built on top of [Git][1].

Basically, it’s a post-receive hook that puts the content of your repo to a
chosen directory, plus it applies some Git metadata (commit hashes, author
names, etc) to your files and generates an Atom feed of the changes you’ve done.

## Todo-list

* Add (pre|post)-build hooks
