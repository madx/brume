Brume
=====

Brume is a lightweight static website manager built on top of [Git][1].

Basically, it's a post-receive hook that pulls out changes you've made to a
given directory, running a script on the files and generating an Atom feed of
updates.

You can use your own builder script, the default one being `/bin/cp`.
You can also use a custom post-processor of your choice.

## Requirements and basic setup

Brume is written in Bash (tested with GNU bash 4.2) and requires only standard
tools (grep, sed,â€¦)

Here are the steps you need to perform to use Brume

    $ cd where/you/want/the/repo
    $ git init --bare
    $ cp path/to/brume/post-receive hooks && chmod +x hooks/post-receive
    $ mkdir www && git config brume.output $(pwd)/www
    $ git config brume.feed.domain <website url>

You can set other options to control various aspects of brume, see the
`head -25` of the `post-receive` file.

Once this is done, simply push your files to the repo and Brume will place them
in the folder specified by the `brume.output` option. Simply point a VHost to
this folder and ta-da, here's your website!

## Settings

* `brume.output`:
  Defines the directory where brume will put the contents of the repository
* `brume.builder`: Foo bar!

## Todo-list

* Add a setup script
